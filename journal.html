	In CS1 so far I have made a code sketch and a person card. I have learned to make functions, about divs, inspect elements, and overall the basics of simple coding. To be honest, Comp Sci is one of my most confusing classes just because the period is so long it is hard for me to focus, and in general I am not a coding inclined person. The labs really help me understand but I feel like in order to completely understand everything I’d have to make 2-3 labs a week. But I’m sure when we all go back in person it will be easier. Sometimes I get a little bit frustrated but I just make sure to schedule a lab and remember any questions I have. I don’t have anything particular I want to work on right now for class. Hopefully we will get to do more personal projects and work on our websites more. Though I didn’t expect this class to be as difficult as it is for me, I still enjoy it.

This week I began working on my website. I’m pretty happy with the way it looks and I’m excited for it all to come together. I just need to test some things and make sure I like the way everything works.

	This week has been pretty easy and fun. I fixed the formatting of my website a bit, and I am about to make a second code sketch. I’m not sure how that will go but we’ll see!
